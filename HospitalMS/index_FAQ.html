							<p class="font">Do I need any special lab test?</b></p>
							Only when you go for intravenous contrast study for x-ray, CT or MRI we test your recent blood creatinine level to know the status of your kidneys; otherwise no test is required.
							 
							<p class="font">Do I need to bring anything along to my appointment?</b></p>
							Yes, you will need to bring the request form from your physician along with previous medical documents and films (if any).
							 
							<p class="font">Can I take medications as advised by my doctor before the exam?</b></p>
							Yes, but if your medication requires food or liquids other than water this may interfere with the study and you should consult your physician or the radiology department for further instructions.
							 
							<p class="font">Is there any preparation required for my exam?</b></p>
							The preparation for your exam depends on the type of study your physician ordered. Please ask your physician for preparation instructions or carefully follow the instruction during the appointment and do not hesitate to ask the same during your appointment if this thing is not explained to you. ALWAYS tell the technologist if you could be pregnant. CT, Mammography and Ultrasound will usually require some preparations.
							 
							<p class="font">Do I need to wear special dress? </b></p>
							Depending on type of  scan you may be asked to change into a patient gown.
							Are family members permitted into the exam room during an obstetrical scan?
							We do not encourage family members to stay in the USG room. However depending on situations the sonologist may permit husband to stay in the USG room
							 
							 
							<p class="font">CT Patients</b></p>
							 
							<p class="font">What is the liquid that I have to drink before the CT exams?</b></p>
							A liquid oral contrast which is iodine containing radio-opeque material is used for CT exams of the abdomen and pelvis. 
							 
							<p class="font">Do I have to get an injection?</b></p>
							Most studies do require an intravenous injection. The technologist will speak to you prior to the study about this contrast. This contrast is vital for the diagnosis of certain pathology.
							 
							<p class="font">How long will the exam last?</b></p>
							CT exam times vary depending on the part of the body being scanned. Actual time on the scan table may range from 5 to 30 minutes. Sometimes a delayed rescan after few hours may be needed. 
							 
							<p class="font">Why do I have special instructions for Metformin (Glucophage, Glucovance, Comet)</b></p>
							Metformin may be taken the day of your exam. It should not be taken for 48 hours following the exam. It may damage your kidneys if it is given before your kidneys start functioning properly
							 
							<p class="font">Mammography Patients</b></p>
							 
							<p class="font">What is mammography?</b></p>
							Mammography is the most effective way to detect breast lumps too small to be felt or seen. A mammogram consists of two low-dose X-rays - one taken from the top of the breast, and one from the side.  Mammograms from all of our sites are also scanned for abnormalities by digital computers.
							Do I need an appointment?
							 No, usually not.
							 
							<p class="font">How long does the test take?</b></p>
							Most mammograms will take between 20-30 minutes.
							 
							<p class="font">Is there any preparation prior to my Mammogram?</b></p>
							Do not apply any perfume, powder or deodorant on the day of your appointment.  If you have had prior mammograms please bring the reports.
							
							<p class="font">What is the advantage of early detection?</b></p>
							Breast cancer, the most frequently diagnosed cancer in women, has a higher cure rate if it is detected in its early stages. Mammography can reveal a malignant tumor or cancer two years before the symptoms appear. 

							<p class="font">What does a mammogram feel like?</b></p>
							During mammography, the breasts must be compressed for a few minutes. This is essential for a more accurate X-ray, and to reduce radiation to the breast tissue. For most women, mammography is not painful. However, some women may experience minor discomfort.

							 
							
							<p>Mammography is very safe. The technique uses low doses of X-ray, and radiation exposure is minimal when screenings are performed by an experienced radiology technologist registered in mammography.</p></b>
